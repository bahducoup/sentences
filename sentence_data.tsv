This seems like a huge challenge	I will never be able to do this
Could you please stop doing that?	If you don't stop, I am going to punch you in the face
I'm not sure if those are the best shoes	You look ridiculous in those shoes

Thank you so much	Thank you, I guess
You seem a bit tired	You should get some rest, you look awful
The way you talk is really unique	Why do you talk that way?
You are not making much sense today	Are you always so stupid or is today a special occasion?
It may be best that you don't talk about things that you are not sure of	Unless your name is Google stop acting like you know everything
I just need to be alone for a while	I would give anything to not see your face right now
That is wonderful news!	So what?
That is hard to believe	Stop lying
Is something wrong?	What now?
Thanks for your concern	What do you care?
I admire your effort	Your work is underwhelming
I don't really understand	What the hell are you talking about?

I don't think so	No
This is pretty hard to understand	How could you not understand this?
Thanks for telling me that	I already knew that
I am really sorry. Please forgive me	I'm not sorry. It's not even that serious
You are such a nice person for doing that	Stop pretending to be so nice
You startled me!	You scared the crap out of me!
I am very upset with you right now	I hate your guts
Could you please be quiet just for a second?	Do you ever stop talking?
I'm sure you'll do better next time	Can't you do anything right?
I think we're going to need to hurry up a little	Why are always so slow?
Things haven't exactly been going my way lately	Why do bad things always happen to me?
Don't worry. It will get better	Don't get your hopes up
Thanks for the advice	You call that advice?
It is difficult, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it	It's too hard for you

You have great taste	You are so pretentious
Great joke!	You think you're funny?

You definitely deserve that	Why would you think that you deserve that?
Can we watch a different movie?	I hate this movie
Calm down and tell me what happened	Stop talking like a crazy person

We are already half way there!	We are still only half way there
Something smells funny	What's that smell? Did you take your shoes off again?
I'm sorry but I still haven't got the water I asked for	Where is that water I asked for?
I think we should remain friends	I would never go out with you
We regret to inform you that we have to let you go	You're fired
We are not that close yet	You don't know me
Working out will be good for your health	You are so fat
You are a little late	Do you know what time it is?
